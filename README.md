A footer to keep social media links. These links are links that open in new tabs so as to not take the user away from the website.

The social media links are useful for the users because they encourage the user to get in contact with the developorer on other platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube). This gives them the ability to interact/contact the company and also research them more.

I ensured that the project is responsive, and the design looks good by using a minimalist approach. In addition I used the devtools to confirm that all devices maintain a good and structured design.

I ensured that the page is readable, and that it is easy to understand the page and the actions that are afforded to the user by links and buttons.
